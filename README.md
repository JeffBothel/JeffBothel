As a cloud and cybersecurity engineer, I have over seven years of experience in cybersecurity, specializing in cloud security and incident response. I have a Master of Science degree in Network and Communications Management with a focus on Information Security, and I hold multiple certifications, including CISSP, CCSP, HCISPP, AWS Solutions Architect Associate, AWS Security Specialty, Azure Solutions Architect Expert, Microsoft Cybersecurity Architect Expert, and CASP+.

My mission is to protect the information assets and systems of our clients and partners from potential threats and risks, by implementing robust security measures and best practices across various cloud platforms and services, such as AWS and Azure. I have successfully integrated security into the development lifecycles of our applications, conducted HITRUST audits, and enhanced our security operations processes and IAM practices. And enjoy sharing all these passions with anyone willing to learn about them.
